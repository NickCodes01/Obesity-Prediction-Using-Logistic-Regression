# Obesity-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is overweight/ obese or normal weight based on lifestyle/ health attributes. Using a publicly available dataset, the pipeline includes data preprocessing, binary target engineering, one-hot encoding, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation using logistic regression.
